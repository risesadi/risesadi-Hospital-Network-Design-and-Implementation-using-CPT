We are living in the age of technology. This technology has brought everything to our fingertips, and its main medium is the Internet or networking. For the purposes of this research, the “Hospital Network Design & Implementation” discipline of Information Systems will structure the overall methodology and framework for results. By leveraging the design science framework, this study will dissect and analyze various parts of a hospital’s network, to uncover substandard practices and problematic weaknesses that commonly result in an overall decrease in the quality of healthcare provided to patients, and negatively affect business operations of hospitals and healthcare facilities. In this network topology the nodes (i.e., computers, Printer switches, routers or other devices) are connected to a local area network (LAN) and network via links (twisted pair copper wire cable or optical fiber cable) which is enough for a smart hospital system. We have used Cisco Packet Tracer for designing the network topology. Here I use Star topology for networking. It’s a general design which can be implemented at any higher level to manage network system for any hospital or health care organization’s network.
